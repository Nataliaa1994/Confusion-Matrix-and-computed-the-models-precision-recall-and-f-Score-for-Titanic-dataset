# Titanic_error_matrix

Exploration data where I am, checked about missing data. During the data preprocessing part, I computed missing values, converted features into numeric ones,
grouped values into categories and created a few new features. Afterwards Istarted training 2 different machine learning models.
Lastly, I looked at itâ€™s confusion matrix and computed the models precision, recall and f-score. (Also CabinTransformer was created.)
